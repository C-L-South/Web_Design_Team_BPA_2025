                <h3>Our Team</h3>

                <p>
                    We're a small but passionate team including <strong>Cody Li</strong> and <strong>Swadhin Nepal</strong> who built
                    <em>Mindscape</em> with a purpose to make mental health awareness more open, relatable, and accessible for everyone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We created a website where people can share mental health expriences, book appointments, and have access to information and resources
                    about mental health. This website was thoughtfully designed in order to achieve a more empathetic community for all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through <em>Mindscape</em>, we hope to inspire honest conversations, spread awareness, and encourage small daily actions
                    that nurture emotional strength, balance, and connection.
